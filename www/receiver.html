                            <p>After suffering with heart blockages, I finally presented to hospital for treatment and operated on for thirteen hours and told that I was now a candidate for a heart transplant.
                                    As a fit, hard working young man and father of four, this came as a surprise to my family. After waiting for four years in 2000, I got the call that a heart was available and I had my first transplant.
                                    Unfortunately, in 2006 I was back in hospital with heart failure. I was told I needed a second heart transplant. After learning to walk, talk and eat again I was released from hospital and within a month of my discharge I was able to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and see my children get married. I now have grandchildren and three weddings to attend.
                                    I am currently the President of the Australian Heart/Lung Transplants Association and I am forever grateful to the two people who have given me the gift of life.
