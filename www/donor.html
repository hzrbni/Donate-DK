                                        Mr. Swilling and the couple's three children proved to be unsuitable matches and they faced a lengthy waiting list for a suitable organ.
                                        In September 2013, their hopes and wishes were finally granted after retired Navy lieutenant commander Kelly Weaverling donated one of her kidneys in a lifesaving operation.
                                        The procedure was hailed as a success, with the couple meeting Ms. Weaverling to personally thank her for her generous gift.

"I was listed for a liver transplant in September 2001. I was familiar with the concept but didn't know many details about transplantation," says Afatamah. "When the call came just one month later to tell me that a liver was available, it was surreal. I was speechless, it all happened so quickly."
Following the transplant, Afatamah felt an immediate renewed energy and has written to her donor family to express her gratitude for the gifts she was given, most importantly the gift of watching her family grow. Since her transplant, she has seen the birth of 10 great-grandchildren and celebrated eleven more anniversaries with her husband, Shaka.
"Organ donation is such an amazing gift and I appreciate every additional day I've been given."
