                                    to keep mine.” Julie Alex's mum Alex was diagnosed with a rare form of heart disease,
                                    before he was born. The condition meant he had no pulmonary valve and at two weeks old,
                                    he had an operation. Alex was given a donated heart valve. Alex is now a happy child
                                    although he will need more procedures throughout his life. Alex´s mum, Julie, said: "He
                                    is doing fab though, his heart is doing great and looking at him you wouldn't even know
